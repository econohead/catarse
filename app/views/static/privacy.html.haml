  %p We strive to offer the best experience possible in order run and manage users' fund raising campaigns for the benefit of their project. We do require users to signup and login. For users signing in with another service's account, i.e., Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc., we do not collect and/or store information other than your username. Instead, we exchange a "token" with the service provider in order to authenticate your account with the designated service.
  %p Beyond signing up to use RoundSeed, RoundSeed requires some basic information for the following purposes:
  %ol
    %li Project Creators – Those interested in submitting a project will need to provide the following information: Full name, email, address, and telephone number. This information will only be required once a user's project has been selected to appear on RoundSeed.
    %li Supporters / Backers – Users who "seed," "back" or support a project will need to provide their full name, email, address and telephone, which are requirements of our payment processors. RoundSeed will need, and share, your email with the project creator in order for the successful project creator to make contact with you regarding your rewards.  
  %p We respect your right to privacy. We do not give or sell your name or any personal information to third parties. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
  %p RoundSeed, LLC. ("RoundSeed," "we," or "us") acknowledges that you care how your information is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours RoundSeed will collect when you use RoundSeed.com and related services (the "Service"), how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information.

We use cookies to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie does not collect personal information about you.
  %p Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.

Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting (e.g., project information) to the Service may become available to the public. If you remove User Content, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your User Content.
  %p eMail: We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear what we have to say.

  %p RoundSeed may use certain information about you and/or your User Content without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing advertisements and promotions.
  %p RoundSeed reserves the right, but is under no obligation, to monitor the content you post on the site. RoundSeed has the right to remove any such information or material at its own discretion, including without limitation, if in its sole opinion, such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Use agreement or to protect or defend its rights or property or those of any third party.

  %h2 How We Share Your Information
  %p RoundSeed will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others.

  %p Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, RoundSeed will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of RoundSeed, our users or others.
  %p Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain RoundSeed services.
  %h2 How We Protect Your Information
  %p RoundSeed uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to RoundSeed and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, RoundSeed makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. We use a variety of security measures, including encryption and authentication tools, to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information. Your personal information is stored behind firewalls and is only accessible by a limited number of people who are required to keep the information confidential. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. 
  %p To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from RoundSeed, at all times.
  %p When you place orders we use a secure server. To the extent you select the secure server method and your browser supports such functionality, all credit card information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
  %p Regardless of these efforts by us, no data transmission over the public Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
  %h2 What Happens When Your Personal Information Is Compromised
  %p In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, RoundSeed will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
  %h2 Children's Policy
  %p Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, RoundSeed does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on RoundSeed. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at #{mail_to t('site.email.privacy')}.

  %p It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our Website page, as determined by RoundSeed in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.
  %h2 Changes to Our Privacy Policy
